# Problem3 (https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/)

# TC : O(m√ón) where m and n are the dimensions of the board

# SC : O(1) since we modify the board in-place

# Approach: 
    # In-place modification: The algorithm updates the board directly without using extra 
    #                  space for a complete copy, which is the requirement of the problem.
    # Two-pass approach:
        # First pass: Marks cells that will change state using intermediate 
        #            values (2 and 3)
        # Second pass: Converts these intermediate values to their final states
    # Careful state tracking:
        # Uses 2 to represent cells transitioning from dead (0) to alive (1)
        # Uses 3 to represent cells transitioning from alive (1) to dead (0)    
    # Boundary checking: Ensures we only check valid neighboring cells
    # Simultaneous updates: By using intermediate states, we ensure all transitions happen 
    #                      simultaneously as required by the rules of the Game of Life.
